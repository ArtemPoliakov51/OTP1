# SPRINT 2 REVIEW REPORT
## 29.1.2026 - 12.2.2026

### Sprint Goal
Main goal of the sprint was to start the development for the Attendance Checker-app.
This included designing and starting the implementation of the UI for the Attendance Checker-app as well as developing and creating the relational database for the app. 
The plan was to also start writing some code functions and unit tests for them.

### Completed User Stories / Tasks
User stories were not the in the center of attention, so there were not many completions on that area. A couple of users stories were completed in a very basic level:

- "As a teacher, I want to log in to the app, so that I can be sure that data is relevant to me."
- "As a teacher, I want to see all my active courses/classes, so that I can keep track of all my courses/classes and easily select one."

Other completed tasks are:

- Designing the database: An ER-diagram and relational database diagrams were created
- Implementing the database --> The database creation script and needed seed data was written, as well as backend code for database connection and database table creation.
- Testing the database with CRUD methods --> Database was tested with SQL tests, as well as with Unit Tests for the DAO classes.
- Designing the UI (with Figma) --> The wireframe for different views of the app were created.
- Setting up the project coding environment --> MVC model was created and object-relationl-mapping was implemented.
- Starting to implement the UI in to the app --> JavaFX code was written for the login view and for the basic common layout as well as for the all courses -view.
- Starting to write the code for the app --> Backend has been written (DAO classes, entities, connection class, some controllers).
- Writing unit tests for the code --> DAO classes were unit tested to also test the database.
- Integrating code coverage reporting --> JaCoCo was implemented to the project for test reports.

### Demo Summary
The following parts were shown in the demo:

- Figma wireframe for the app's UI
- Database architecture (ER diagram and relational schema)
- Unit tests and database testing
- Code coverage report (JaCoCo)
- Written code for the app (frontend and backend)

### What Went Well
All tasks goals and tasks that were planned for this sprint were reached and done, at least in some level. 
Some user stories were also completed which were more optional than required goals for this sprint to be completed if time allowed.
The app's UI designed and it looks complete.
Database seems to work as intended and implemented plugins and dependencies seem to also work.

### What Could Be Improved
Group communication seems to be bit of a problem. Communication could be more active, and group members could show their work more visibly (commits, comments, screeenshots etc.)
Work distribution could also be better. It has been quite unbalanced without any given reasons. 
Tasks have also been done really slowly, on the day of the deadline or even after it. Deadlines had to be moved foward beacause of this.
The written code needs better onrganization and some documentation/comments for improved communocation and understanding.

### Next Sprint Focus
The focus of the next sprint is to get a working version of the app. This includes the UI with fronend code and the backend code.
Focus is also on integrating Jenkins for CI/CD.
